Lab2 contains basics for file and directory manipulation, and R data input and output. Rather than a complete collection of functions, I will introduce the frequenty-used functions from my own R experience.

## File and Directory Manipulation

`setwd()`, `getwd()`

```{r}
setwd("")
```

`list.files()`

`file.create()`

`file.exists()`

`file.remove()`

`file.copy()`

`dir.create()`

## Capturing Results from Console

`print()`

`sink()`

## Imports and Exports

`read.table()`, `write.table()`

`read.csv()`, `write.csv()`

`read.xls()`, `write.xls()`

`load()`, `save()`

`data()`

`read.dbf()`
